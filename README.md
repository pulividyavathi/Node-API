# Node-API
Hello Everyone,

I'm excited to introduce my project, built using express.js, along with several essential npm libraries.
I embarked on this project as a learning experience, following the guidance of the tutorial by @devtamin on YouTube.
It has been a rewarding journey that has enabled me to acquire new skills and knowledge.
I've successfully implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in this project. 
These operations involve making HTTP requests and handling responses to interact with the server.
To store and manage data, I've utilized MongoDB as our database solution. 
This ensures efficient and organized data storage and retrieval within the application.


Environment Setup:
To run this application, follow these steps in Visual Studio Code:

Open your terminal.
Execute the following commands:
 
npm install
npm run dev
Please ensure that you've installed all the necessary libraries, as specified in the project's code package.json, by visiting npmjs.com.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to this project. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued. 
Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey!
